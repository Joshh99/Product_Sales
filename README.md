# Product Sales Analysis
Welcome to the "Product Sales" analysis project, aimed at providing insightful data on the effectiveness of the sales approaches for a recently launched office stationery product line. This analysis is crucial for informing decision-making strategies and optimizing sales efforts.

# Project Overview
Our focus revolves around three distinct sales methods:

- Email: Customers received two emailsâ€”one at the product line launch and another three weeks later. This method requires minimal team effort.
- Call: Sales team members personally called customers, spending an average of 30 minutes per customer.
- Email and Call: Customers in this group received an initial product email and a follow-up call a week later, requiring 10 minutes per customer.

# Objectives
- Customer Count:
    - Determine the number of customers for each sales approach.
- Revenue Spread:
    - Analyze the overall revenue spread.
    - Break down revenue distribution for each sales method.
- Revenue Over Time:
    - Explore revenue trends over time for each sales method.
- Recommendations:
    - Provide insights to recommend the most effective sales approach based on data.
    - Consider time investment for each method.
 
# Data and Analysis
